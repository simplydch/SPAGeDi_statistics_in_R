# SPAGeDi_statistics_in_R
Implementations of several of the statistics calculated in SPAGeDi (Spatial Pattern Analysis of Gene Diversity) directly in R, allowing more efficient analyses when using SNP data

There is also various pieces of code for interacting with SPAGeDi from within R, including creation of input files, running the program and importing the output.

Currently still very much a work in progress in terms of making the scripts and functions understandable and user friendly.

The included functions are far from exhaustive and are mainly just those that I required for the analyses that I was doing.  However, I'm happy to try and incorporate more components of SPAGeDi into R if I receive interest in doing so.
